# [hungry-local-storage](https://github.com/Dias1c/hungry-local-storage)

ðŸ’¾âŒ› Local storage tool but with expiration time (auto delete expired data).

## About

This is a simple tool for storing data in localStorage with expiration time. It's useful for storing temporary data, such as user preferences, but also for storing data that is not needed after a certain period of time.

### Why hungry-local-storage?

The reason why I called this package `hungry-local-storage` is that he is a endlessly hungry thats allowed to eat only after the item store time expires. And it checks at specified intervals (every N seconds you specified) whether the object's storage period has expired so that it can be eaten. Such an obedient hungry tool.

## Usage

### Installing

```sh
$ npm i "@diaskappassov/hungry-local-storage"
```

### Usage

#### Setting values to localStorage with expiration

```ts
import { hls } from "@diaskappassov/hungry-local-storage";

// No expire time
hls.set("cherry", "string");

// Expires after 60 seconds
hls.set("banana", 123, 60);

// Expires after 3600 seconds
hls.set("apple", [1, 2, 3], 3600);

// Expires after 90 seconds
hls.set("persimmon", { text: "This is object" }, 90);

// Expires after 10 minutes
hls.set("avocado", {}, { minutes: 10 });

// Expires after 3 days
hls.set("tea", {}, { days: 3 });

// Expires after 7 seconds + 6 minutes + 5 hours + 4 days+ 3 weeks + 2 months + 1 year
hls.set("cake", "CAAAKE!", {
  seconds: 7,
  minutes: 6,
  hours: 5,
  days: 4,
  weeks: 3,
  months: 2,
  years: 1,
});
```

#### Getting value from localStorage

Imagine that you run `hls.set("apple", [1, 2, 3], 3600);`, and you want to get this value from localStorage.

```ts
import { hls } from "@diaskappassov/hungry-local-storage";

// Returns parsed value if not expired, otherwise returns null with removing expired item from localStorage
const apple = hls.get("apple");

console.log(apple); // [1, 2, 3]
```

#### Removing expired items from localStorage

```ts
import { hls } from "@diaskappassov/hungry-local-storage";

// Removes all expired items and returns count of removed items by function flush
const countRemoved = hls.flush();
console.log("flush returned:", countRemoved);
```

> Don't worry, flush not removes localStorage items that's not have expiration field on top level of structure.

#### Setting Auto Flush

By default auto flush is disabled. You, to enable it, need to set auto flush value in seconds.

```ts
import { hls } from "@diaskappassov/hungry-local-storage";

// Set auto flush that runs flush every 10 minutes
hls.setAutoFlush(60 * 10);
```

> If you run `setAutoFlush` method twice with different values, then the last value will be used and it finishes all old `autoFlush` timers.

If you set auto flush value to `null` then auto flush will be disabled.

```ts
import { hls } from "@diaskappassov/hungry-local-storage";

// Disable auto flush
hls.setAutoFlush(null);
```

#### Removing item from localStorage

```ts
import { hls } from "@diaskappassov/hungry-local-storage";

// Removes item with key "apple".
hls.remove("apple");
```

> Under code `hls.remove` just runs `localStorage.removeItem` method
